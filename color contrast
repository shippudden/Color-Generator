The calculateBrightness function calculates the brightness of a color represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., #RRGGBB). Brightness, in this context, refers to how light or dark a color appears.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

hex: This is the input parameter to the function, representing a color in hexadecimal format, such as #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hexadecimal values representing the red, green, and blue components of the color, respectively.

parseInt(hex.slice(1, 3), 16): This line extracts the red component from the hex color. The hex.slice(1, 3) extracts characters at positions 1 and 2 (0-based index) of the hex string, which corresponds to the red component. The parseInt function with 16 as the second argument converts the hexadecimal value into a decimal number.

parseInt(hex.slice(3, 5), 16): This line extracts the green component from the hex color, similar to the previous line.

parseInt(hex.slice(5, 7), 16): This line extracts the blue component from the hex color, similar to the previous two lines.

The brightness of a color is calculated using a formula that takes into account the relative contributions of each color channel (red, green, and blue) to human perception. The formula used here is called the "luminance" formula, which is commonly used to estimate the perceived brightness of a color.

r * 299: The red channel is multiplied by 299, as it contributes most significantly to perceived brightness.
g * 587: The green channel is multiplied by 587.
b * 114: The blue channel is multiplied by 114.
These weights are based on the sensitivity of the human eye to different colors.

Finally, the sum of these weighted values (r * 299 + g * 587 + b * 114) is divided by 1000 to normalize the result. The division by 1000 ensures that the brightness value falls within a reasonable range.

The resulting value represents the brightness of the color, with higher values indicating lighter colors and lower values indicating darker colors. This calculated brightness value can be used to determine whether the text color should be light or dark for optimal contrast against the background color. Typically, a threshold value around 128 is used to decide between light and dark text colors.
